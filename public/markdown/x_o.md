A classic **3x3 grid** game built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, featuring smooth gameplay and persistent state.

This project was implemented as part of a guided full-stack learning path on [BeCoder](https://becoder.dev/en/app), a platform for improving software development skills through hands-on projects. All code, logic, and architecture were developed independently based on the provided specifications.

## 🚀 Features
