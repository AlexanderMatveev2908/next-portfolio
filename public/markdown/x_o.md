A full-featured calculator app inspired by the native iOS calculator. Built with precision and edge-case handling in mind.

## ✅ Features

- 🧮 **Chained operations** (e.g. `2 + 3 * 4`) processed safely
- 🚫 **Division by zero prevention** — no infinite loops, no crashes
- 🧠 **Smart input validation**
  - Prevents multiple consecutive operators (`++`, `*/`, etc.)
  - Blocks duplicate decimal points (`12.3.4` won't happen)
- 💅 Sleek UI that mimics the iOS experience

# Hello World

This is a **bold** text, and this is _italic_.

- Item 1
- Item 2

```ts
const test = "Hello Markdown!";
```

```bash
npm install bananas
echo "🍌 is installed!"
```

## ✅ TL;DR

| Feature       | Explanation                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `code` blocks | Just UI — shows code as text                                                   |
| Parsed?       | Yes, for syntax highlighting                                                   |
| Executed?     | ❌ No — not run or interpreted                                                 |
| Safe?         | ✅ Yup — no XSS or script injection unless you mess with dangerous props       |
| Live preview? | Only if you manually wire up a live evaluator (like CodeMirror, Sandpack, etc) |
