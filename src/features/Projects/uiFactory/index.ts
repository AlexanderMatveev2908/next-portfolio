    description: `A full-stack e-commerce application built with the PERN stack, designed to support multiple independent bookstores under a single unified system. It includes a robust role-based authentication system that allows store owners to assign roles such as Manager and Employee, enabling fine-grained control over store operations.
    Each bookstore operates with its own isolated inventory, while customers can browse and purchase books from multiple stores within a single, unified cart. The checkout process is powered by Stripe, with full integration of webhooks to handle real-time payment confirmations and order updates.
    The platform also provides comprehensive account management features, including password resets, email changes, account recovery, and secure account deletion. Its security model is built on a layered token strategy: access tokens are implemented using signed JWTs for fast verification; refresh tokens are encrypted using JWE (RSA-OAEP + AES-GCM) to ensure confidentiality and prevent tampering; and one-time-use tokens, such as those used for password resets and email verification, are secured using HMAC with CBC-SHA for integrity.
    The application is Dockerized for deployment, with a single container serving both the API and frontend via Express. Development environments support HTTPS through the use of mkcert, ngrok, and an NGINX reverse proxy, ensuring security and reliability even during local testing.`,
